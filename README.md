**Reproducible workflow:**    
Raw 16S rRNA sequence reads are publicly available as [NCBI BioProject PRJNA533183](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA533183). Additional data are available [here](https://github.com/sklasek/svalflux/tree/master/data).  
[Our amplicon sequence processing workflow is available here](https://github.com/sklasek/svalflux/blob/master/markdowns/1_sequence_processing.md).  
If you're cool with the way we've processed our sequences, you can begin with the phyloseq object .

If you're cool with how we've removed unwanted sequences, decontaminated, and pruned samples with too few reads, you can begin working with the phyloseq object ps.frdp in /data.
Porewater geochemistry, modeled AOM rates, and ddPCR gene count data are available in the /data folder. 


R code is available in /markdowns that can be followed in numerical order (1 through 4, from sequence processing to community analysis). 
If you're just here to see the figures without the code, they are in documents numbered 5 and 6 (main figures and supplemental figures).
