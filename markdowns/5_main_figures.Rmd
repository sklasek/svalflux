## Figure 1: Map of study area

Figure 1. Bathymetric map of Storfjordrenna gas hydrate mounds and modeling approach. (A) Storfjordrenna is located south of the Svalbard Archipelago. Locations of cores and gas hydrate mounds (GHMs) are shown. White polygons indicate areas of seafloor gas release observed at the time of the cruise. All cores were collected from GHMs, with the exception of the reference core GC1048, which was sampled 400 m west of GHM5. The schematic in (B) depicts sulfate and methane concentrations throughout a sediment column at a steady-state condition. As methane flux increases, (C), SR-AOM is stimulated at shallower depths and sulfate profiles show a concave-up curvature. After decades of steadily increasing methane flux at a particular area, (D), reactive-transport modeling can be used to estimate how quickly the methane front diffused the distance between the current and prior sulfate depletion depths (indicated by the orange bracket).


## Panel figures from three methane flux regimes:

### Figure 2, steady-state cores:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=11.5, fig.height=10, fig.align="center"}
grid::grid.draw(figure2)
```

Figure 2. Geochemical, numerical, microbial community, and gene abundance data from four sites showing steady-state sulfate-methane dynamics. GC1068â€“1070 are from GHM5, and reference core GC1048 is located to the west of GHM5. Sulfate-methane transition depths are indicated by dashed lines. (A) shows porewater sulfate, sulfide, and alkalinity, and (B) present-day modeled AOM rates. (C) indicates percent abundances of dominant bacterial and archaeal classes, dominant anaerobic methanotrophic archaeal (ANME) familes, and sulfate-reducing bacterial (SRB) genera.(D) shows copy numbers of mcrA and dsrAB genes per gram bulk sediment, with values below the detectable limit (10^3 g-1) along the margin of the panel. Macroscopic translucent-to-yellow biofilms, shown as yellow symbols in panel (A), were observed at approximate SMT depths in cores GC1048 and GC1070 (symbol size not to scale with depth axis). 

### Figure 3, increasing methane flux:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=13, fig.height=6, fig.align="center"}
grid::grid.draw(figure3)
```

Figure 3. Geochemical, numerical, microbial community, and gene abundance data from two sites showing sulfate-methane dynamics suggestive of recent increases in methane flux. Gravity cores GC1045 and GC1081 are located at GHMs 3 and 4, respectively. Sulfate-methane transition depths are indicated by dashed lines. (A) shows porewater sulfate, sulfide, and alkalinity, and (B) the temporal progression of modeled AOM rates from 10 years ago to up to 2 years after sampling. (C) indicates percent abundances of dominant bacterial and archaeal classes, dominant anaerobic methanotrophic archaeal (ANME) familes, and sulfate-reducing bacterial (SRB) genera. (D) shows copy numbers of mcrA and dsrAB genes per gram bulk sediment.

### Figure 4, active methane seepage:   

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.height=5, fig.align="center"}
grid::grid.draw(figure4)
```

Figure 4. Geochemical, microbial community, and gene abundance data from an active seep site. Push core PC1029 is located at the seep in the center of GHM3. (A) shows porewater sulfate, sulfide, and alkalinity concentrations in addition to frenulate siboglinid tubeworms and gas hydrate nodules several cm in diameter recovered in a replicate core at 40-50 cm below seafloor. (B) depicts percent abundances of dominant Bacterial and Archaeal classes within the microbial community (left panel), dominant anaerobic methanotrophic archaeal (ANME) families (center panel) and sulfate-reducing bacterial (SRB) genera (right panel). (C) shows log10 copy numbers of mcrA and dsrAB genes per gram bulk sediment. 

## Figure 5, differentially abundant ASVs across zones and methane flux types:

```{r, fig.height=6.5, fig.width=9, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
figure5 # actually exported at 9.17 x 6.91
```

Figure 5. Differentially abundant ASVs between three discrete stages of methane dynamics, either above or below the sulfate-methane transition zone. Higher differential abundance values represent stronger associations between an ASV and a particular group. In addition to position relative to the SMTZ, vertical panels convey class-level taxonomic annotations for all taxa except ANME (at family level) and SRB (at genus level). Bubble sizes represent mean percent abundances within each group. Differential abundance was inferred using an alpha of 0.05 and a Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons. 

## Figure 6, alpha-diversity (diversity within communities):

```{r, echo=FALSE,  fig.width=6, fig.height=5, fig.align="center"}
grid::grid.draw(figure6) 
```

Figure 6. Microbial community diversity patterns across peak modeled AOM depths. Shannon diversity indices of microbial communities for individual samples plotted by their distance above (positive) or below (negative) the depths corresponding to present-day maximum AOM rates across all cores. Cores are divided by panel based on whether methane flux is (A) high, or (B) low, and colored according to different stages of methane dynamics. Dotted horizontal lines show the distance interval corresponding to high methane flux samples. Multiple R^2 and slope p-values are shown for linear regressions of points within these intervals. 


## Figure 7, beta-diversity (diversity between communities):

The two most helpful categories that explain the most of the variance within these microbial communities are methane stage and redox zone. There is a significant interaction among them too.   

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4.5, fig.align="center"}
library(patchwork)
ord1.p.stage + ord1.p.zone
```

Figure 7. Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) ordination of weighted Unifrac distances between all communities, colored according to stages of methane dynamics (A), and redox zone within the sediment column (B). A Hellinger transformation was applied to ASV count tables before calculating the distance matrix. PERMANOVA tests verify distinct community structures present across stages and redox zones, with R^2 and p-values shown in corresponding plots.  


## Figure 8, conceptual figure 

![](/Users/scottklasek/Desktop/svalflux/figures/flux.conceptual.2.png)

Figure 8. Conceptual depiction of microbial community changes concurrent with distinct stages of methane dynamics at Storfjordrenna GHMs. Methane and sulfate profiles are shown in gray and blue lines, respectively, with microbial community changes indicated by blowup circles. ANME and SRB represent red and green ovals, with other bacteria and archaea in gray (shapes representing the diversity of other taxa). (A) Methane seepage, potentially driven by dissociation of gas hydrates at the upper limit of stability, stimulates high rates of AOM and densities of ANME/SRB. Sulfide fluxes from AOM are sufficient to support frenulate siboglinid tubeworms, which may irrigate sulfate over the upper several cm of sediment, increase redox gradients in underlying sediments, and further ANME/SRB growth. (B) In the absence of bioirrigation, a concave-up bend in porewater sulfate suggests recent methane migration into the sulfate-reduction zone that may have resulted from a pulse of methane beginning around 290 years ago. Methane travels upward throughout the sediment column, and ANME/SRB growth follows with less than a year of lag time, driving down alpha diversity. (C) Steady-state sulfate profiles suggest no recent methane influx, and low rates of AOM are observed at the SMTZ. Stable conditions may allow for higher microbial diversity and the growth of macroscopic biofilms.
